## Coding Challenges Practise for Tech Interview

1. Missing Number
   Given an array of numbers from 1 to n, one number is missing.
   Write a function to find the missing number.

   Input - an array of integers
   output - single integer

   summation formula - n\*(n+1)/2

   #### Example test cases

   test case 1:
   input => [2]
   output => 2

   test case 2:
   input => [1,3]
   output => 2

   test case 3:
   input => [1,4,5,3,2,7,9,8]
   output => 6

   Edge cases - Array has a non-integer or an empty array

2. Prime number checker
   Write a function that checks if a given number is prime (only divisible by 1 and itself).

   input - number
   output - string telling whether the number is prime or not.

   test case 1:
   input: 2
   output - 2 is a prime number

   input: 4
   output: 4 is not a prime number

   edge cases - numbers less than or equal to 1
